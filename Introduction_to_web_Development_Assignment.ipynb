        "- There are 2 main components of Client-Server architecture which are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Client**\n",
        "    - **Server**\n",
        "\n",
        "  These both are used to provide communication and data exchange between devices. Following is the brief introduction of main components of client-server architecture and their Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "## - Introduction to Client\n",
        "      Client is any device or software application that request services or resource from a server, in computer context.\n",
        "      Example : Like Web Browser, Email Client, etc.\n",
        "      Request consists of \"Type of Resource\" or \"service being requested\".\n",
        "      Basically Client sends a request containing the specific details of what it is looking for.\n",
        "      Client Devices : \"Computers\", \"Laptops\", \"Smartphones\", \"Tablets\" etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "## - Introduction to Server\n",
        "      Servers are devices or sofware application that provide service or resources to clients.\n",
        "      All the request came from client is being processed by server, it performs necessary actions and Calculations, and then returns the result back to client in requested format.\n",
        "      Example : like hosting websites, storing and retrieving files, or managing email communication.\n",
        "      Servers are connected to internet or computer network, allowing them to communicate with clients located anywhere in the world.\n",
        "      Servers are designed to be highly reliable and available, with advanced features such are redundancy and load balancing to ensure that they can handle large Traffic and requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Q2. Discuss the various career paths available after completing a web development course.**\n",
        "- There are 3 Major Paths with some other paths, these paths are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Frontend Developer** - Looks after the UI / UX part as a developer\n",
        "    - **Backend Developer** - Looks after the Business Logic and data storing in database which works behind the scene.\n",
        "    - **Full Stack Developer** - Looks after for UI / UX part as a developer and as well as the buisness logic and data storing in the database which works behind the scene.\n",
        "    - Mobile App Developer - Can use backend Knowledge with react native to build Mobile app, just something changes from the tech stack.\n",
        "    - Database Engineer - Looks after the complex database queries and interation. Works mostly with complex data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Q3. Describe the role of a web browser's developer tools in web development.**\n",
        "- Developer Tools help developers debug, test, and optimize web applications. These tools provide real-time insights into a webpage's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, network activity, and performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are developer tools like Elements, Console, Network, Performance, Source, Application, Security.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Key Features of DevTools:\n",
        "\t1.\tElements Tab : Allows developers to inspect and modify HTML & CSS in real time.\n",
        "\t2.\tConsole Tab : Displays errors, warnings, and logs related to JavaScript execution.\n",
        "\t3.\tNetwork Tab : Monitors API requests, loading times, and HTTP status codes.\n",
        "\t4.\tPerformance Tab : Helps analyze and improve the loading speed and responsiveness of web pages.\n",
        "\t5.\tSources Tab : Enables debugging JavaScript code using breakpoints.\n",
        "\t6.\tApplication Tab : Shows cookies, local storage, session storage, and indexedDB data.\n",
        "\t7.\tSecurity Tab : Provides insights into SSL certificates and potential security vulnerabilities.\n",

        "# **Q4. What are the advantages of using a Version Control System like Git in a development project?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Git is a distributed version control system that helps teams manage code efficiently. It provides several advantages:\n",
        "  1. Code Versioning\n",
        "    - Keeps track of changes made to the code.\n",
        "    - Allows developers to revert to previous versions if needed.\n",
        "  2. Collaboration & Teamwork\n",
        "    - Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.\n",
        "    - Branching and merging allow parallel development.\n",
        "  3. Backup & Security\n",
        "    - Code is stored in repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, preventing data loss.\n",
        "    - Version control ensures safe rollbacks if something breaks.\n",
        "  4. Branching & Merging\n",
        "    - Developers can create feature branches without affecting the main codebase.\n",
        "    - Changes can be merged after proper testing.\n",
        "  5. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)\n",
        "    - Automates testing and deployment processes.\n",
        "    - Ensures smooth updates without breaking existing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \n",
